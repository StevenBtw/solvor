"""
Breadth-first and depth-first search for unweighted graphs.

BFS finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs, exploring level by level. DFS
explores deeply first, useful for connectivity, reachability, and when you
don't care about shortest path. Both are O(V + E), the difference is queue
vs stack.

Use this for: mazes, grid navigation, finding any path, flood fill, checking
if two nodes are connected. When goal is None, explores all reachable nodes.

    from solvor.bfs import bfs, dfs

    result = bfs(start, goal, neighbors)           # shortest path
    result = dfs(start, goal, neighbors)           # any path
    result = bfs(start, None, neighbors)           # all reachable nodes

For weighted graphs, use dijkstra. For heuristic search, use astar. For
negative edges, use bellman_ford.
